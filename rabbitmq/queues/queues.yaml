# Operator notes
notes: |
  - All queues are durable by default for message persistence
  - Critical queues use quorum queues for guaranteed delivery
  - Lazy queues used for archival and metrics to optimize memory
  - TTL values can be adjusted based on specific needs
  - Max lengths prevent unbounded queue growth
  - Dead letter handling for failed message management
  - Priority levels: 10 (highest) to 1 (lowest)
